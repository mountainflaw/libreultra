# libreultra
An open libultra decompilation brought you to by a couple of clever folks.

## What is this?

This is the N64 standard SDK library. It is normally closed source, but recently has been decompiled (with a 1:1 match when recompiled using the original compiler) from the game *Super Mario 64*. Unfortunately, there are a couple of functions that I have deemed useful that were not used in SM64 (and were discarded by the linker) and are thus included from the libultra source code provided from the N64 SDK. ***The Oman archives were not used in any way for this project.***
